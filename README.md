üôè Acknowledgments
Built with vanilla JavaScript and modern browser APIs. Special thanks to the WordPress REST API and Google Sheets API documentation.

Note: Never share your API keys or credentials. Always use environment-specific configurations for production deployments. For the highest security, I recommend using a zero-trust security model for protecting the tool, e.g. CloudFlare Zero Trust.
